# Checkpoint Stale Reference Fix Summary

## Problem Solved
The issue where animations had stale references to mobjects after multiple jumps has been fixed using a hybrid approach.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Store Animation Creation Info Instead of Objects
Instead of storing animation objects (which contain stale mobject references), we now store:
- Animation class name
- Mobject variable names
- Animation kwargs

### 2. Recreate Animations on Playback
When playing forward, we:
- Restore to the start state
- Look up mobjects by name from stored locals
- Create fresh animation instances
- Play the animations

### 3. Hybrid Approach for Complex Animations
- **Simple animations** (Create, FadeOut, Transform, etc.): Recreated from specs
- **Complex animations** (.animate syntax): Fall back to re-execution

## Benefits
1. **Fixes stale references** - Fresh animations always reference current mobjects
2. **Less memory usage** - Storing specs instead of objects
3. **Cleaner logic** - No complex remapping needed
4. **Reliable** - Falls back to re-execution for complex cases

## Code Changes
1. Added `get_mobject_name()` to find variable names
2. Added `get_animation_class()` to look up animation classes
3. Modified `play()` to store animation specs instead of objects
4. Updated `play_forward()` to recreate animations from specs

## Testing Results
- Basic animations work perfectly with the recreation approach
- No duplicate objects when jumping back and playing forward multiple times
- Complex animations (.animate) safely fall back to re-execution

## Usage
The checkpoint system now handles all navigation patterns correctly:
- Jump back and play forward repeatedly
- Mix jumping and playing in any order
- File edits and auto-reload continue to work

The stale reference issue is completely resolved!
