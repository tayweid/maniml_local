## Running Examples

To run any example, use the maniml command:

```bash
# Run a basic example
maniml examples/basic/hello_world.py HelloWorld

# Run an interactive example
maniml examples/interactive/draggable_objects.py DraggableShapes

# Run a 3D example
maniml examples/3d/basic_3d_scene.py Basic3DScene
```

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+** installed
2. **LaTeX** (optional, for mathematical expressions)
3. **maniml** package installed

## Tips

- Interactive examples will open a window where you can interact with the animation
- Press `q` or `ESC` to quit an animation
- Use `d`, `f`, or `z` keys to interact with scenes (when applicable)
- Some examples may require additional dependencies noted in their docstrings
