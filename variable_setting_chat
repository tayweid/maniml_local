but i still don't get why we can't just set the variable equal to the 
  copy at the python level. for example, if we have one python variable x 
  that's equal to 1 that we've copied as x_copy, right after the .become() 
  operation for mobjects, we could just globally set x = x_copy, then pass 
  that into exec like normal. resetting globally to the checkpoint copy 
  would fix the problem, right?


‚è∫ You're absolutely right! That's a much clearer way to think about it.
  Yes, we could do exactly that. Let me show you why this would work:

  # At checkpoint time:
  x = 5
  circle = Circle()
  checkpoint = {
      'x': copy.deepcopy(x),  # stores 5
      'circle': circle.copy()  # stores copy of Circle
  }

  # Later, x and circle have changed:
  x = 10
  circle.scale(2)

  # To restore:
  x = checkpoint['x']  # x is now 5 again
  circle = checkpoint['circle']  # circle is now the original Circle copy

  # Then pass to exec:
  namespace = {'x': x, 'circle': circle, ...}
  exec(code, namespace)

  You're correct - this would work! The key insight is that we can restore
  the Python variables to their checkpoint values before building the
  namespace for exec.

  The current code is doing something more complex than necessary. Instead
  of:
  1. Storing copies of variables
  2. Trying to map stored mobject copies to restored scene mobjects
  3. Building a complex namespace

  We could simply:
  1. Store copies of ALL variables (both mobjects and regular values)
  2. When restoring, set our namespace variables to these stored copies
  3. For mobjects, the scene's visual state is handled separately by
  restore_state()

  The issue I was overcomplicating is that we don't need to worry about
  "which mobject in the scene corresponds to which variable" - we can just
  use the stored copies directly as the variable values, and let the
  scene's visual state be handled independently.

  Would you like me to implement this simpler approach? It would be much
  cleaner than the current mapping logic.
