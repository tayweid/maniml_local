# Checkpoint System Restructure Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Core Navigation Functions Added
- `run_next_animation(current_checkpoint)` - Executes code from file with proper commenting
- `play_next_animation(current_checkpoint)` - Replays stored animations 
- `jump_to_next_animation()` / `jump_to_previous_animation()` - State navigation without replay

### 2. Arrow Key Behavior Updated
- **UP/LEFT**: Jump to previous animation (state only)
- **DOWN**: Jump to next checkpoint OR run new code if none exists
- **RIGHT**: Play next stored animation OR run new code if none exists

### 3. Code Extraction Enhancement
- `_extract_code_with_comments()` - Comments out executed lines while preserving indentation
- Proper handling of multi-line statements
- Line number preservation for accurate error reporting

### 4. Multi-line Statement Handling
- Checkpoints now store the END line of multi-line play() calls
- Uses AST parsing to find end_lineno for accurate checkpoint positioning
- Prevents partial statement execution errors

### 5. File Change Handling
- `edit_checkpoint(smallest_line, largest_line)` - Clean algorithm for handling edits
- Finds checkpoint before edit, deletes after, runs until past edit region
- Simplified `_handle_file_change()` to use edit_checkpoint

## Key Improvements

1. **Cleaner Control Flow**: Separate functions for each navigation action
2. **Accurate Line Tracking**: Multi-line statements handled correctly
3. **Robust Code Extraction**: Comments preserve indentation structure
4. **Predictable Behavior**: Clear separation between replay and new execution
5. **Key Blocking**: Prevents race conditions during animation execution

## Testing

The system now correctly:
- Navigates between checkpoints with arrow keys
- Replays stored animations when available
- Executes new code when beyond stored checkpoints
- Handles file changes and hot reload
- Preserves state and local variables through navigation

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements:
- Visual checkpoint indicator
- Checkpoint persistence (save/load)
- True reverse animation playback (currently just jumps)
- Better handling of interactive elements during navigation
