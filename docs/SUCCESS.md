# maniml Working!

## What We've Accomplished

maniml is now successfully running ManimCE code using the ManimGL backend! 

### Key Features Working:
1. **Text rendering** - Using GL's Text with font mapping
2. **Basic shapes** - Circle, Square, etc.
3. **Animations** - FadeIn, FadeOut, Create, Transform, Write
4. **Movement animations** - Shift, MoveTo, Scale (via ApplyMethod)
5. **Scene methods** - play(), wait(), add(), remove()
6. **Coordinate systems** - Axes with plot() method
7. **Color constants** - All CE colors mapped to GL

### Import Fixes Completed:
- ✅ ShowPassingFlash - Import from indication module
- ✅ ClockwiseTransform - Created custom implementation
- ✅ FadeInFromLarge - Created custom implementation  
- ✅ SpinInFromNothing - Created custom implementation
- ✅ Wiggle - Mapped to WiggleOutThenIn
- ✅ Shift/MoveTo/Scale - Created as ApplyMethod wrappers
- ✅ Three_d_scene import - Fixed to import from main scene module
- ✅ Axes recursion - Fixed coords_to_point infinite loop

### How to Use:
```bash
# Run any ManimCE script with maniml
maniml your_ce_script.py YourCEScene

# The maniml command automatically:
# 1. Rewrites imports from 'manim' to 'maniml'
# 2. Calls manimgl with the modified script
# 3. Opens an interactive GL window
```

### What's Happening:
- maniml provides a compatibility layer that translates CE API calls to GL
- You get CE's familiar API with GL's fast OpenGL rendering
- Interactive window allows real-time scene manipulation
- Press Esc or Cmd+Q to close the window

The project successfully achieves the goal of putting the ManimCE API on top of ManimGL's backend!
