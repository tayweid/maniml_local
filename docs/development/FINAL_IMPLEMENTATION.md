# Final Auto-Reload Implementation

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Simplified Approach
- Removed all complex threading, queues, and Pyglet scheduling
- Uses a simple flag-based approach for thread safety
- File watcher sets a flag, main thread checks it

### 2. Thread-Safe Design
```python
# Background thread (file watcher):
lambda: setattr(self, '_file_changed_flag', True)

# Main thread (update_frame):
if self._file_changed_flag:
    self._file_changed_flag = False
    self._handle_file_change()
```

This prevents OpenGL operations from happening on background threads, which was causing crashes.

### 3. Simple Reload Logic
- Find changed line
- Find checkpoint before that line
- Restore state
- Run code after checkpoint

Just like ManimGL's checkpoint_paste, but automatic!

### 4. Window Size
The config should now work properly:
```yaml
window:
  size: (1536, 864)  # 80% of 1920x1080
  position_string: "OO"  # Center
```

## Testing

1. Run the test:
   ```bash
   maniml final_test.py FinalTest
   ```

2. Edit line 15: Change `Square` to `Circle`

3. Save the file

You should see:
- "File changed! Auto-reloading..."
- The square should be replaced with a circle
- No crashes!

## Key Features

- ✓ Automatic file watching
- ✓ Smart checkpoint restoration
- ✓ Thread-safe (no crashes)
- ✓ Simple implementation
- ✓ Works like checkpoint_paste

## How It Works

1. **File Watcher**: Background thread detects changes, sets flag
2. **Main Thread**: Checks flag during `update_frame()`
3. **Reload**: Restores checkpoint, runs updated code
4. **Namespace**: Includes all necessary imports and mobjects

The implementation is now much simpler and thread-safe!
