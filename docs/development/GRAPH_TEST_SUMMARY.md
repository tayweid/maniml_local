Successfully implemented and tested graph theory visualizations in maniml.

### Tests Completed:

1. **BasicGraphTest** âœ…
   - Basic undirected graph creation
   - Circular layout
   - Vertex highlighting and labeling
   - Manual graph creation fallback
   - Directed graphs with arrows
   - Tree structures and BFS traversal
   - Multiple layout algorithms (circular, grid)
   - Graph algorithm visualizations (Dijkstra's shortest path)

2. **NetworkGraphTest** âœ…
   - Social network visualization
   - Node creation with labels and icons
   - Connection/edge visualization
   - Influence spreading animation
   - Network statistics display

3. **GraphMatrixTest** âœ…
   - Graph to adjacency matrix conversion
   - Matrix visualization with cells
   - Edge-matrix correspondence highlighting
   - Degree calculation from matrix

### Features Implemented:

#### Graph Class
- Created custom `Graph` class for maniml
- Supports both undirected and directed graphs
- Multiple layout algorithms:
  - Circular layout
  - Tree layout (BFS-based)
  - Grid layout
  - Custom layout with positions
- Vertex and edge configuration
- Label support
- Path highlighting
- Neighbor queries

#### Graph Animations
- Vertex creation/highlighting
- Edge drawing and coloring
- Path traversal animations
- BFS/DFS visualizations
- Influence spreading
- Layout transformations

#### Graph-Matrix Integration
- Adjacency matrix visualization
- Matrix cell coloring based on edges
- Correspondence between graph edges and matrix entries
- Degree calculation visualization

### Key Achievements:
1. Full graph theory support in maniml
2. CE-style API for graph creation
3. Multiple layout algorithms
4. Rich animation capabilities
5. Integration with other maniml features (Text, Shapes, etc.)
6. Matrix representations of graphs

### Usage Example:
```python
from maniml import *

# Create a graph
vertices = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1)]

graph = Graph(
    vertices, 
    edges,
    layout="circular",
    vertex_config={"color": BLUE, "radius": 0.3},
    edge_config={"color": WHITE}
)

# Add labels
labels = graph.add_vertex_labels({
    1: "A", 2: "B", 3: "C", 4: "D", 5: "E"
})

# Animate
self.play(Create(graph))
self.play(Write(labels))

# Highlight a path
path_anims = graph.highlight_path([1, 2, 3], color=RED)
self.play(*path_anims)
```

The graph functionality is fully integrated with maniml and provides all the tools needed for graph theory visualizations!
