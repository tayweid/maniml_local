# LaTeX Fix Summary

## Problem
LaTeX rendering was failing with a FileNotFoundError because the `tex_templates.yml` file was missing from the maniml package.

## Solution
1. **Updated tex_file_writing.py**: Changed the path from `os.path.join(get_manim_dir(), "manimlib", "tex_templates.yml")` to `os.path.join(get_manim_dir(), "tex_templates.yml")`

2. **Created tex_templates.yml**: Added the missing file at `/Users/taylorjweidman/ANIMATE/maniml/maniml_package/maniml/manimgl_core/tex_templates.yml` with standard LaTeX templates:
   - `default`: Standard LaTeX template with common packages
   - `ctex`: XeLaTeX template for Chinese text support
   - `english`: Same as default but explicitly for English
   - `empty`: Minimal template with no preamble

## Verification
Successfully tested LaTeX rendering with:
- Simple math expressions: `x^2 + y^2 = 1`
- Complex equations: integrals, summations, vector calculus
- Colored LaTeX: `E = mc^2` in blue
- Axes labels: Mathematical function labels on graphs

## Usage
LaTeX now works out of the box in maniml:
```python
from maniml import *

class LaTeXExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        equation = MathTex(r"x^2 + y^2 = r^2")
        self.play(Write(equation))
```

## Requirements
- External LaTeX installation (latex/pdflatex command)
- dvisvgm for converting DVI to SVG
- Standard LaTeX packages listed in tex_templates.yml
