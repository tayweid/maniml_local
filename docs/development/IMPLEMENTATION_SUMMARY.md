# maniml Implementation Summary

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Window Aspect Ratio Preservation ✓
- **Problem**: Window resizing was distorting the animation content
- **Solution**: Implemented viewport-based letterboxing in `on_resize()` method
- **Result**: Content maintains proper aspect ratio with black bars as needed

### 2. Real-time Window Resize Updates ✓
- **Problem**: Window only updated after mouse release
- **Solution**: Added immediate frame updates in resize handler
- **Result**: Smooth, responsive resizing

### 3. Larger Window on Startup ✓
- **Problem**: Default window was too small (50% of screen)
- **Solution**: Created `custom_config.yml` with 80% screen size
- **Result**: Window opens at 1536x864 instead of 960x540

### 4. ESC Key to Exit ✓
- **Problem**: ESC didn't exit the IPython terminal
- **Solution**: Added `on_key_press()` handler that raises `EndScene()`
- **Result**: ESC closes both window and terminal cleanly

### 5. Checkpoint System (like ManimGL) ✓
- **Features**:
  - Automatic checkpointing on every `play()` and `wait()`
  - `checkpoint_paste()` for running clipboard code
  - `jump_to(n)` for instant navigation
  - `list_checkpoints()` to see all checkpoints
  - Named checkpoints using comments

### 6. Auto-Reload System ✓
- **Features**:
  - Automatic file watching (checks every second)
  - Smart change detection using line-by-line comparison
  - Restores to checkpoint before changes
  - Executes only new/changed code
  - Stays in interactive mode (no exit/restart)
  - Shows what code is being executed

## Key Files Modified

1. **`maniml/scene/scene.py`**:
   - Added Scene class with CE compatibility on GL backend
   - Implemented all features above
   - ~700 lines of checkpoint and auto-reload logic

2. **`maniml/scene/file_watcher.py`**:
   - Simple file watching implementation
   - Animation tracking utilities

3. **`examples/custom_config.yml`**:
   - Window configuration for larger size

## Usage Examples

### Basic Interactive Scene
```python
from maniml import *

class MyScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        circle = Circle(color=BLUE)
        circle.name = "circle"  # Named for easy access
        self.play(Create(circle))
        
        self.interactive_embed()  # Enter interactive mode
```

### Testing Auto-Reload
1. Run: `maniml auto_reload_demo.py AutoReloadDemo`
2. Edit the file while it's running
3. Save - changes apply automatically!

### Interactive Commands
```python
# In interactive mode:
list_checkpoints()      # Show all checkpoints
jump_to(3)             # Jump to checkpoint 3
checkpoint_paste()     # Run clipboard code
reload()               # Manual reload if needed
```

## How It Works

1. **File Watching**: Background thread monitors file modification time
2. **Change Detection**: Compares new content with stored original
3. **Smart Restoration**: Finds checkpoint before first change
4. **Partial Execution**: Runs only code after the checkpoint
5. **State Preservation**: Window and IPython session stay alive

## Key Differences from Other Implementations

- **vs ManimGL**: No module reloading, no scene recreation
- **vs ManimCE GL**: Automatic file watching instead of manual paste
- **vs Standard Manim**: Interactive development with hot reload

The implementation provides a smooth development experience where you can iterate on animations without constantly restarting the scene.
