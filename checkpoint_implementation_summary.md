# Checkpoint System Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### Core State Management
- Added `self.checkpoints` list for new checkpoint system
- Added `self.current_checkpoint` for tracking position
- Added `self.tight` boolean for execution state management
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy `animation_checkpoints`

### Key Functions Implemented

1. **`start()`** - Initializes checkpoint system with blank screen
2. **`run_next_code()`** - Executes code after current checkpoint
3. **`run_exec()`** - Core execution function with animation control
4. **`reexecute()`** - Re-runs code without animations to rebuild state
5. **`comment_out_to_line()`** - Extracts code with executed lines commented
6. **`code_upto_line()`** - Extracts executable code up to a line
7. **`get_namespace()`** - Creates execution namespace with stored locals
8. **`play_forward()`** - Replays animation using stored info
9. **`jump_to()`** - Instantly jumps to checkpoint state
10. **`jump_back()`** - Convenience method for backward navigation
11. **`remap_stored_animations()`** - Maps stored animations to current mobjects
12. **`on_edit()`** - Handles file changes intelligently

### Arrow Key Behavior

- **Right Arrow (→)**: Plays next animation forward
  - If checkpoint exists: replay animation
  - If at end: execute new code (with reexecute if slack)
  
- **Down Arrow (↓)**: Jump to next checkpoint instantly
  - If checkpoint exists: jump without animation
  - If at end: create new checkpoint

- **Left/Up Arrow (←/↑)**: Jump to previous checkpoint
  - Instant state restoration
  - Sets tight=False (slack state)

### State Synchronization

The system maintains perfect synchronization between:
- Scene mobject states (using ManimGL's SceneState)
- Local Python variables (stored at each checkpoint)
- Animation objects (for accurate replay)

### Memory Optimization

- Uses ManimGL's SceneState optimization (reuses unchanged mobject copies)
- Limits checkpoint storage to last 50 checkpoints
- Efficient state restoration using `become()` method

## Testing Results

The implementation successfully:
- Creates checkpoints at each `play()` call
- Navigates between checkpoints with arrow keys
- Handles file edits and auto-reload
- Maintains state consistency during navigation
- Provides smooth animation replay

## Benefits Over Previous System

1. **Cleaner Architecture**: Functions match the spec exactly
2. **Better State Management**: Explicit tight/slack states
3. **Efficient Replay**: Stored animations play without re-execution
4. **Robust Edit Handling**: Smart checkpoint restoration on file changes
5. **Developer Friendly**: Clear function names and responsibilities

## Usage Example

```python
from maniml import *

class MyScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        circle = Circle()
        self.play(Create(circle))  # Checkpoint 1
        
        self.play(circle.animate.shift(UP))  # Checkpoint 2
        
        # Use arrow keys to navigate between these checkpoints!
```

The checkpoint system is now fully operational and provides a powerful tool for developing and debugging Manim animations.
